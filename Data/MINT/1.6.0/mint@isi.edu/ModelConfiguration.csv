1813f422-8fc5-4e20-9948-1f83234d66fd,,GHOST - Clear Creek,"The Clear Creek Watershed (CCW) includes activities in the upper watershed to reduce flooding and improve water quality, as well as infrastructure projects in the city of Coralville to protect commercial and residential property from flooding.

The Clear Creek Watershed covers 66,132 acres (104 square miles), spanning parts of Iowa and Johnson counties in Southeast Iowa. Clear Creek empties into the Iowa River at Coralville. The watershed lies entirely within the Southern Iowa Drift Plain, comprised of glacial deposits broken up by many small creeks that have molded the landscape into rolling hills and valleys. Abundant rainfall and fertile soils allowed the conversion of the natural prairie and forested landscape to large-scale intensive agriculture, consisting mainly of a corn-soybean rotation. Eighty-four percent of cropland in the upper portions of the watershed is classified as highly erodible. Intensive agriculture on these soils in a moist climate, coupled with stream channelization in the headwaters and increasing urbanization in the lower portions of the watershed, contribute to flash flooding and water-quality degradation after intense spring storms.

The city of Coralville is set along Clear Creek where it joins the Iowa River, leaving it particularly vulnerable to flooding. Recent floods have had a devastating impact on the local economy, causing many businesses to relocate. Unprotected storm sewer discharge points along the creeks and river leave systems vulnerable to backwater. The city determined that it was imperative to construct flood mitigation projects, especially for the existing storm sewer system, to protect businesses and residents from future floods. The Iowa Watershed Approach will provide funding for the city to reconstruct Stormwater Pump Stations (PS) 7 and 8 to the same design level as all other Coralville flood mitigation projects. PS 7 protects about 42.8 acres of developed property, and PS 8 protects about 135.9 acres. This project will benefit every property owner and tenant within these regions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hydrology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://iowawatershedapproach.org/resources/ghost/clear-creek/
37d17ee0-0ce6-4095-9f32-90c1b33859f2,,Central Valley Hydrologic Model,"CVHM Components 1. Geospatial Database A Geographic Information System (GIS) was used to compile, manage, store, and analyze the large quantities of data in the geospatial database needed to run the model, and to understand and visualize the data output. 2. Texture Model The texture model is key to understanding how water moves through the Central Valley groundwater system. Scientists developed the geologic texture model to describe the coarseness or fineness of valley-fill materials that make up the aquifer system, and then used it to estimate hydraulic properties for every cell in the model grid. To create the model, lithologic data from approximately 8,500 drillers' logs of boreholes ranging in depth from 12 to 3,000 feet below land surface, along with other information, were compiled and analyzed. 3. Farm Process The complex hydrologic system of the Central Valley is simulated using the USGS hydrologic modeling software, MODFLOW. Combined with the Farm Process, MODFLOW simulates natural and human-induced water movement and consumption over the landscape and accounts for supply-constrained and demand-driven conjunctive use of surface and groundwater in agricultural, urban, and natural settings. For the Central Valley, the tool simulates unmetered historical pumping and surface-water deliveries for 21 water-balance regions for water years 1962 to 2003. 4. Numerical Model A numerical groundwater-flow model capable of being accurate at scales relevant to water-management decisions was developed for the Central Valley, California. The modeling software is MODFLOW2000 with the Farm Process (FMP).",7ada3329-1e8b-41f0-9a5a-bd4d31e59827,,,,,,,,,"Hydrology, Agriculture, Geospatial Database, Texture Model, Farm Process, Numerical Model",,,,Hydrology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46fd5e0a-6819-4646-b468-9ba268364ccf,,GHOST - Middle Cedar,"The Middle Cedar River Watershed (MCWMA) is a 1.5M-acre watershed that spans parts of 10 counties in Eastern Iowa. It encompasses primarily the Iowan Surface landform, characterized by long, gently rolling hills and well-developed stream networks. The MCRW is part of the Cedar River Basin that stretches from Minnesota to Southeast Iowa, where it meets the Iowa River. The MCRW includes some of the richest farmland in the nation. Seventy-three percent of the land is dedicated to row crop agriculture and seed corn production. The MCRW also supports a substantial portion of Iowa’s urban areas, including Cedar Rapids, Waterloo, and Cedar Falls.

In 2013, the MCRW was identified as a priority watershed under the Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy. The statewide Water Quality Initiative (WQI) selected five HUC 12s in the Middle Cedar for initial implementation of projects aimed at improving water quality. The City of Cedar Rapids helped secure $2M through the USDA-NRCS as part of the Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP) for a program called the Middle Cedar Partnership Project (MCPP). The MCPP leveraged $2.3M in partner contributions. The WQI, MCPP, and IWA projects in the Middle Cedar complement one another and will work together to reduce downstream flooding and improve water quality.

A Middle Cedar Watershed Management Authority (WMA) was formed in 2016 to bring partners together to address watershed concerns.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hydrology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://iowawatershedapproach.org/resources/ghost/middle-cedar-river/

The Upper Iowa River Watershed (UIRW) is part of the Driftless Region of Iowa. Its karst topography features limestone bluffs that rise 250 to 450 feet above the valley floor, dozens of coldwater trout streams, nearly 3,000 sinkholes and waterfalls, and hundreds of springs. Cropland accounts for more than 40% of the watershed, which also includes grassland (35%) and hardwood forests (19%). The EPA and Iowa recognize the UIRW as a Priority Watershed. Iowa designates 244 miles of the Upper Iowa River as High-quality Resource Waters or High-quality Waters, and the Upper Iowa was among the initial rivers included in the National Wild and Scenic River System.

The UIRW is a popular tourist destination. It has excellent walleye and bass fishing, but is best known for its 152 miles of coldwater trout steams, which lure anglers from around the world. More than 150 protected species of animals and plants live in the watershed, which also harbors endangered ecosystems.

This long, narrow watershed is located in the northeast corner of Iowa and encompasses 991,980 acres, touching portions of 11 Iowa counties. The watershed lies in the Iowan Surface Region, characterized by broad, gently-rolling slopes and heavily wooded floodplains. The watershed is more than 85% row crop, pasture, or grass and is heavily used for recreation, including fishing, canoeing, hunting, and wildlife watching. According to a survey by ISU’s Center for Agriculture and Rural Development, visitors made approximately 226,801 trips to the Upper Wapsipinicon River in 2009 and spent $6M on outdoor recreation activities.

The Wapsipinicon River is a State of Iowa Protected Water Area (PWA) known for its public greenbelt corridor, which includes floodplain forests and wetlands, steep bluffs, and wildlife habitat, all with associated water-quality benefits. The Iowa DNR found the Wapsipinicon River to have the longest continuous stretch of natural and scenic river corridor in the Iowan Surface Region. Sixteen of the 27 communities in the watershed are located on, or adjacent to, a stream or river, providing recreational and economic opportunities that are impacted by flooding. There are currently 159 miles of impaired waters in the UWRW, inclduing 17 segments of impaired streams.

In September 2014, 13 communities, eight counties, and nine Soil and Water Conservation Districts united to form the Upper Wapsipinicon River Watershed Management Authority (UWRWMA).
