4dbf94c8-93fb-4b20-a9fa-f6fa2d7df871,,TracerLPM,,"Lumped parameter models are mathematical models of transport based on simplified aquifer geometry and flow configurations that account for effects of hydrodynamic dispersion or mixing within the aquifer, well bore, or discharge area. Five primary LPMs are included in the workbook: piston-flow model (PFM), exponential mixing model (EMM), exponential piston-flow model (EPM), partial exponential model (PEM), and dispersion model (DM). Binary mixing models (BMM) can be created by combining primary LPMs in various combinations. Travel time through the unsaturated zone can be included as an additional parameter. TracerLPM also allows users to enter age distributions determined from other methods, such as particle tracking results from numerical groundwater-flow models or from other LPMs not included in this program. Tracers of both young groundwater (anthropogenic atmospheric gases and isotopic substances indicating post-1940s recharge) and much older groundwater (carbon-14 and helium-4) can be interpreted simultaneously so that estimates of the groundwater age distribution for samples with a wide range of ages can be constrained.

TracerLPM is organized to permit a comprehensive interpretive approach consisting of hydrogeologic conceptualization, visual examination of data and models, and best-fit parameter estimation. Groundwater age distributions can be evaluated by comparing measured and modeled tracer concentrations in two ways: (1) multiple tracers analyzed simultaneously can be evaluated against each other for concordance with modeled concentrations (tracer-tracer application) or (2) tracer time-series data can be evaluated for concordance with modeled trends (tracer-time application). Groundwater-age estimates can also be obtained for samples with a single tracer measurement at one point in time; however, prior knowledge of an appropriate LPM is required because the mean age is often non-unique.

LPM output concentrations depend on model parameters and sample date. All of the LPMs have a parameter for mean age. The EPM, PEM, and DM have an additional parameter that characterizes the degree of age mixing in the sample. BMMs have a parameter for the fraction of the first component in the mixture. An LPM, together with its parameter values, provides a description of the age distribution or the fractional contribution of water for every age of recharge contained within a sample. For the PFM, the age distribution is a unit pulse at one distinct age. For the other LPMs, the age distribution can be much broader and span decades, centuries, millennia, or more. For a sample with a mixture of groundwater ages, the reported interpretation of tracer data includes the LPM name, the mean age, and the values of any other independent model parameters.

TracerLPM also can be used for simulating the responses of wells, springs, streams, or other groundwater discharge receptors to nonpoint-source contaminants that are introduced in recharge, such as nitrate. This is done by combining an LPM or user-defined age distribution with information on contaminant loading at the water table. Information on historic contaminant loading can be used to help evaluate a model’s ability to match real world conditions and understand observed contaminant trends, while information on future contaminant loading scenarios can be used to forecast potential contaminant trends.",825498fb-6178-453e-ba47-0aa7ec71bf5e,,"lumped parameter model; groundwater age modeling; age tracers; environmental tracers, hydrologic tracer",,,Hydrology,,,,,https://ca.water.usgs.gov/user_projects/TracerLPM/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TracerLPM is an interactive Excel® (2007 or later) workbook program for evaluating groundwater age distributions from environmental tracer data by using lumped parameter models (LPMs). ,https://www.usgs.gov/software/tracerlpm,,,Excel

Model calculations include potential evapotranspiration, calculated from solar radiation with topographic shading and cloudiness; snow, as it accumulates and melts; and excess water moving through the soil profile, which is used to calculate actual evapotranspiration and climatic water deficit—the difference between potential and actual evapotranspiration. Depending on soil properties and the permeability of underlying bedrock, surface water can be classified for each cell as either recharge or runoff. Post-processing calculations are made to estimate baseflow, streamflow, and potential recharge to the groundwater system for watersheds.

7600b79a-b1e2-402c-8ee4-6ab581bd10e1,,MODPATH Observation Process,,"The MODPATH-OBS (Hanson and others, 2013) computer program is designed to calculate simulated equivalents for observations related to advective groundwater transport that can be represented in a quantitative way by using simulated particle-tracking data. The simulated equivalents supported by MODPATH-OBS are

distance from a source location at a defined time, or proximity to an observed location;
time of travel from an initial location to defined locations, areas, or volumes of the simulated system;
concentrations used to simulate groundwater age; and
percentages of water derived from contributing source areas.
Although particle tracking only simulates the advective component of conservative transport, effects of non-conservative processes such as retardation can be approximated through manipulation of the effective-porosity value used to calculate velocity based on the properties of selected conservative tracers. This program can also account for simple decay or production, but it cannot account for diffusion. Dispersion can be represented through direct simulation of subsurface heterogeneity and the use of many particles.

MODPATH-OBS acts as a postprocessor to MODPATH, so that the sequence of model runs generally required is MODFLOW, MODPATH, and MODPATH-OBS. The version of MODFLOW and MODPATH that support the version of MODPATH-OBS presented here are MODFLOW-2005 or MODFLOW-LGR, and MODPATH-LGR. MODFLOW-LGR is derived from MODFLOW-2005, MODPATH 5, and MODPATH 6 and supports local grid refinement. MODPATH-LGR is derived from MODPATH 5. It supports the forward and backward tracking of particles through locally refined grids and provides the output needed for MODPATH_OBS. For a single grid and no observations, MODPATH-LGR results are equivalent to MODPATH 5. MODPATH-LGR and MODPATH-OBS simulations can use nearly all of the capabilities of MODFLOW-2005 and MODFLOW-LGR; for example, simulations may be steady-state, transient, or a combination. Though the program name MODPATH-OBS specifically refers to observations, the program also can be used to calculate model prediction of observations.

MODPATH-OBS is primarily intended for use with separate programs that conduct sensitivity analysis, data needs assessment, parameter estimation, and uncertainty analysis, such as UCODE_2005, and PEST.

In many circumstances, refined grids in selected parts of a model are important to simulated hydraulics, detailed inflows and outflows, or other system characteristics. MODFLOW-LGR and MODPATH-LGR support accurate local grid refinement in which both mass (flows) and energy (head) are conserved across the local grid boundary. MODPATH-OBS is designed to take advantage of these capabilities. For example, particles tracked between a pumping well and a nearby stream, which are simulated poorly if a river and well are located in a single large grid cell, can be simulated with improved accuracy using a locally refined grid in MODFLOW-LGR, MODPATH-LGR, and MODPATH-OBS. The locally-refined-grid approach can provide more accurate simulated equivalents to observed transport between the well and the river.

1) Find your field location using a map. Cycles is a point-based model, and you will need information about the soil and weather for the point being simulated.

2) [Expert users/modelers] Check the default control properties. These can be found in the Cycles control file. In the MINT configuration of Cycles, this file is not exposed, but can be found by downloading the component and looking at the technical details.
 
3) Check the soil values for the chosen location (by default Cyles uses [GSSURGO](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/home/?cid=nrcs142p2_053628)) properties from your field location.
 
4)  Select the weather location (by default Cycles tries to use the closest GLDAS grid) for your field location. A python script is used to read GLDAS netCDF4 files, aggregate subdaily GLDAS forcing data to daily resolution, and output the daily variables in text format to be used by Cycles.
 
5) **[Expert users/modelers]** Create operations for your field location using the Operation Panel and/or Timeline. In the MINT configuration of Cycles, this file is not exposed, but can be found by downloading the component and looking at the technical details.

6) Inspect/visualize model results.


**Scenario**: In our case we want to calculate the Seasonal Crop Production Index for the Pongo basin in South Sudan, because it provides a fast and robust way of reporting normalized yields for a given grid point or region. The goal of the index is to easily segment “years” or “seasons” that can be problematic for food production, and to provide an intuitive sense of the magnitude of the problem. The raw yield outputs might be difficult to interpret for non-experts, and index is more transparent.

The Seasonal Crop Production Index is based on the ratio of the yield of a given combination of planting date, fertilization and weed pressure to the median yield under such conditions across years:
 
 * An index = 1 means that the year resembles the median years, and it is assumed that it represents a neutral condition (neither local excess or shortage of food supply). 
 * An index > 1 means that the local food supply may exceed the median, and the larger the number the better off the location. The caveat here is that flooding damage might be underestimated. As we refine our simulations this limitation will be lifted.
 * An index < 1 means a situation worse than normal, and the lower the value the worse the situation. It is safe to assume that this is a reliable indicator of local food shortage.

**Data sources**:When attempting to follow the steps indicated above, the most difficult challenge is finding weather and soil files for our target region, as they are not available in GSSURGO or NLDAS. Therefore we selected the soils information from [USDA](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/survey/tools/?cid=nrcseprd1407030), and [Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS)](https://ldas.gsfc.nasa.gov/gldas) for the weather data. GLDAS has coarser temporal resolution than NLDAS, but has global coverage which is critical in our use case.

**Results**: We executed Cycles in 209 locations we selected in the Pongo region, selecting ""Maize"" as our target crop and with multiple fertilization rates and weed fraction. Figure 1 shows the Variation of the Seasonal Crop Production Index for maize for one agricultural grid point in the Pongo Basin, after consolidating the results of each of the executions. The nitrogen rates represent from low to high fertilization (for the agronomy minded, 78 to 1250 kg/ha of raw fertilizer with 32% nitrogen). The 0.4 in the legend indicates the weed pressure (medium). The planting dates are not shown here, but an analyst can easily explore their impact by expanding the data selection. Clearly, years 2011, 2016 and 2017 in particular were problematic.

---
**Scenario**: The South Sudan government plans to implement a regional fertilizer subsidy program to help the farmers in Pongo Basin area to achieve a higher level of yield and alleviate the food insecurity issue. The rate of fertilizer subsidy has not yet decided. 

An analyst can use EACS within MINT to simulate how different levels of fertilizer subsidy rate (ranging from 10% to 50%, fully subsidized) would lead to different levels of output variables such as production and land use for each type of crops considered in the model. Based on the simulation results, analysts can decide what’s the optimal rate of fertilizer subsidy rate they want to apply in reality. The economic model consists of a numerical simulation of a non-linear constrained optimization problem that is calibrated to reflect observed decision-making in the study region. The calibration approach uses Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP), which ensures that the simulation model reflects unobserved constraints (e.g., access to credit, labor availability, crop rotation practices) that affect decisions about agricultural production. By varying related parameters (prices, land/fertilizer cost) one at a time between -50 and 50 (increment by 10) for each crop (cassava,  sorghum, maize, groundnuts, and sesame), simulated crop production results are generated to predict how farmers react to potential economic condition changes.

The model is an aggregate and represents decision-making by all agricultural households in the study region. The model predicts agricultural production, taking into account the behavioral response of farming households to changes in environmental, economic, and policy drivers. Output variables include the total amount of land in agricultural production, the amount of land and fertilizer used per unit area in the cultivation of each of the region’s crops, average crop yields, and net revenues earned in agricultural production. For the Pongo Basin in South Sudan, the model generates these output variables for maize, cassava, sorghum, groundnuts, and sesame seed crops.

In our scenario, analysts are trying to determine an optimal fertilizer subsidy rate for farmers in Pongo Basin to promote crop yield in 2017 lean season. The fertilizer subsidy rate can vary from 10% to 50%. 
Initially, the baseline simulated crop yield and production are displayed in Figure 1:  


![Fig1](https://files.mint.isi.edu/s/ILn4cnLyy8V0eRI/download)

**Figure 1: Estimated baseline yield and production per crop**


By imposing a 20% fertilizer subsidy, we expect the farmers to use more fertilizer as inputs for some crops thus leading to higher yield and production level and eventually higher revenue level and alleviate the food insecurity problem in Pongo Basin area during the 2017 lean season. By using EACS, the simulated yield and production level after imposing the intervention (i.e., 20% decrease in fertilizer cost for all crops, assuming the fertilizer subsidy applies to all crops within this area) is displayed in Figure 2.

![Fig2](https://files.mint.isi.edu/s/JLWumO6NrCPW5NR/download)

**Figure 2: Estimated yield and production per crop with a 20% decrease in fertilizer cost for all crops**
  
By comparing the baseline and intervention (20%) outputs, analysts may find a 20% fertilizer subsidy program lead to higher yield level for cassava and maize and higher production level for sorghum. Since the goal of the economic model is to maximize the total revenue of the farmers within this area, analysts would see the farmers make new decisions on fertilizer use and land allocation on different crops based on different interventions they choose. 

Under the same logic, analysts can run similar simulations for 10%. 30%, 40% and 50% fertilizer subsidy interventions and check the new outcomes. We display only two outcome variables of Economic model: Yield and Total Production. Extra outcome variables such as land use, fertilizer application rate and total fertilizer use are also available for analysts to check and compare within in the MINT system.  

By running multiple simulations with different economic interventions, analysts would have a general idea of how the proposed policy may impact the agricultural and economic outcomes of their interest area. The economic model outcome variables can also help them to further calculate the cost and benefit of the potential policy and finalize their decisions on policy-making. 

**Data sources**: In this scenario, the model was configured using Food and Agriculture Organization 2015 production data for baseline land use, yield and production level (http://www.fao.org/faostat). 
 Crop price data are World Food Programme database (https://data.humdata.org/dataset/wfp-food-prices-for-south-sudan) and estimated elasticities from related literatures.

The water-balance model uses daily climate records of precipitation and air temperature and a spatially distributed representation of drainage-basin characteristics defined by topography, geology, soils, and vegetation to simulate daily net infiltration at all locations, including stream channels with intermittent streamflow in response to runoff from rain and snowmelt.

Centralized    systems    typically    benefit    from    ""economies    of    scale""    realized    through treatment    in    larger,    more    efficient facilities.However,    larger    scale    systems    require    more    infrastructure    and,    often,    more    pumping    for    both    the    wastewater    being    collected    and    the    treated    water    being     distributed.    Smaller,     decentralized     systems     generally     serve     a     single     building,     a     neighborhood,     or     small    community,    and    the    water    is    reused    in    and    around    the    buildings    where    it    was    generated.In    the    case    of    nitrogen    management,     decentralized     systems     can    utilize source-separating toilets     to     collect urine,     which     is     the     most    concentrated    source    of    nitrogen    in    the    wastewater.    Decentralization    and    source    separation,    however,require    a    complex    logistic    system    for    effective    operation    and    management.    These    tradeoffs    are    generally    understood    but    have    not    been    analyzed    in    depth    as    they    depend    on    many    site-­‐specific    factors. To    address    this    information    gap,    researchers    developed process    models    based    on    technology    performance    and    decision    support    tools    that    identify    optimal    implementation    of    decentralized    water    reuse    systems    and    decentralized    nitrogen    management     with     respect     to     energy     use,    greenhouse     gas    emissions, and     cost.     Spatial     analysis     along     with     a     life-cycle    assessment    (LCA)    of    the    required    infrastructure    is    utilized    to    identify    areas    where    decentralization    would    be    the    preferred    option    compared    to    a    centralized    approach.    Initial    analysis    for    both    NPR    and    nitrogen    recovery    was    performed    using    the    city    of    San    Francisco    as    a    case    study.",ec46e841-4d61-48ed-8454-8b0d42b418a9;64a05f8d-e433-4900-9d01-552efe152c9e;c517e9a9-bb16-46da-a70d-3c7ba82733ed;85050e42-38d4-419f-b06d-1bb713679666;5dd15cc9-a437-449b-87af-1cc304877be3,,life-cycle assessment,,,Decision_Support,,,,,,,"The    tools    developed    in    this    project    help    decision    makers    better    understand    the    tradeoffs    between    system    size    and    performance    for    NPR    and    nitrogen    management    across    scales,    taking    into    account    site-specific    conditions    that    could    affect     optimal     solutions.     Analyzing     the     life-cycle     performance     of     decentralized     technologies     at     different     scales    provides    insights    into    the    economic    and    environmental    costs,    identifies    locations    where    these    systems    perform    best,    and    highlights    potential    implementation    improvements.
