Variables in weather file are considered rigid forcings. Surface conditions do not alter air temperature or moisture. Soil is connected to the residues, aboveground living biomass, air, and radiation from the atmosphere, and with the bottom of the profile. There is no lateral water or solutes movement within the soil profile. When running stand alone, runoff and percolation water simply leaves the simulation unit. Vegetation can be composed of monocultures (single species) or multiple species. The parameters describing each plant of the community are described in the crop file. The operations file allows multiple types of interventions organized as tillage, fertilization, and planting events. Operations like kill crop are part of tillage. To enable coupling with other models, Cycles can be set to replace (re-initialize) internally calculated variable with external inputs. For example, infiltration can be an input from the PIHM model, soil moisture can be reset based on observations or data from other models. This flexibility extends to all state variables. Re-initialization algorithm can break the mass balance and is not recommended unless the goal overrides mass or energy balance concerns. Overall the model is set up to be daily.

General instructions: When using the Cycles AgroEcosystems Model in any region, you should follow the steps indicated below :

1) Find your field location using a map. Cycles is a point-based model, and you will need information about the soil and weather for the point being simulated.

2) [Expert users/modelers] Check the default control properties. These can be found in the Cycles control file. In the MINT configuration of Cycles, this file is not exposed, but can be found by downloading the component and looking at the technical details.
 
3) Check the soil values for the chosen location (by default Cyles uses [GSSURGO](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/home/?cid=nrcs142p2_053628)) properties from your field location.
 
4)  Select the weather location (by default Cycles tries to use the closest GLDAS grid) for your field location. A python script is used to read GLDAS netCDF4 files, aggregate subdaily GLDAS forcing data to daily resolution, and output the daily variables in text format to be used by Cycles.
 
5) **[Expert users/modelers]** Create operations for your field location using the Operation Panel and/or Timeline. In the MINT configuration of Cycles, this file is not exposed, but can be found by downloading the component and looking at the technical details.

6) Inspect/visualize model results.


**Scenario**: In our case we want to calculate the Seasonal Crop Production Index for the Pongo basin in South Sudan, because it provides a fast and robust way of reporting normalized yields for a given grid point or region. The goal of the index is to easily segment “years” or “seasons” that can be problematic for food production, and to provide an intuitive sense of the magnitude of the problem. The raw yield outputs might be difficult to interpret for non-experts, and index is more transparent.

The Seasonal Crop Production Index is based on the ratio of the yield of a given combination of planting date, fertilization and weed pressure to the median yield under such conditions across years:
 
 * An index = 1 means that the year resembles the median years, and it is assumed that it represents a neutral condition (neither local excess or shortage of food supply). 
 * An index > 1 means that the local food supply may exceed the median, and the larger the number the better off the location. The caveat here is that flooding damage might be underestimated. As we refine our simulations this limitation will be lifted.
 * An index < 1 means a situation worse than normal, and the lower the value the worse the situation. It is safe to assume that this is a reliable indicator of local food shortage.

**Data sources**:When attempting to follow the steps indicated above, the most difficult challenge is finding weather and soil files for our target region, as they are not available in GSSURGO or NLDAS. Therefore we selected the soils information from [USDA](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/survey/tools/?cid=nrcseprd1407030), and [Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS)](https://ldas.gsfc.nasa.gov/gldas) for the weather data. GLDAS has coarser temporal resolution than NLDAS, but has global coverage which is critical in our use case.

**Results**: We executed Cycles in 209 locations we selected in the Pongo region, selecting ""Maize"" as our target crop and with multiple fertilization rates and weed fraction. Figure 1 shows the Variation of the Seasonal Crop Production Index for maize for one agricultural grid point in the Pongo Basin, after consolidating the results of each of the executions. The nitrogen rates represent from low to high fertilization (for the agronomy minded, 78 to 1250 kg/ha of raw fertilizer with 32% nitrogen). The 0.4 in the legend indicates the weed pressure (medium). The planting dates are not shown here, but an analyst can easily explore their impact by expanding the data selection. Clearly, years 2011, 2016 and 2017 in particular were problematic.

Markets are assumed complete.,ECONOMIC_AGGREGATE_CROP_SUPPLY_funding,virginia_tech,,"#### Below is a brief illustrative example to understand how this model can be used in MINT.
---
**Scenario**: The South Sudan government plans to implement a regional fertilizer subsidy program to help the farmers in Pongo Basin area to achieve a higher level of yield and alleviate the food insecurity issue. The rate of fertilizer subsidy has not yet decided. 

An analyst can use EACS within MINT to simulate how different levels of fertilizer subsidy rate (ranging from 10% to 50%, fully subsidized) would lead to different levels of output variables such as production and land use for each type of crops considered in the model. Based on the simulation results, analysts can decide what’s the optimal rate of fertilizer subsidy rate they want to apply in reality. The economic model consists of a numerical simulation of a non-linear constrained optimization problem that is calibrated to reflect observed decision-making in the study region. The calibration approach uses Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP), which ensures that the simulation model reflects unobserved constraints (e.g., access to credit, labor availability, crop rotation practices) that affect decisions about agricultural production. By varying related parameters (prices, land/fertilizer cost) one at a time between -50 and 50 (increment by 10) for each crop (cassava,  sorghum, maize, groundnuts, and sesame), simulated crop production results are generated to predict how farmers react to potential economic condition changes.

The model is an aggregate and represents decision-making by all agricultural households in the study region. The model predicts agricultural production, taking into account the behavioral response of farming households to changes in environmental, economic, and policy drivers. Output variables include the total amount of land in agricultural production, the amount of land and fertilizer used per unit area in the cultivation of each of the region’s crops, average crop yields, and net revenues earned in agricultural production. For the Pongo Basin in South Sudan, the model generates these output variables for maize, cassava, sorghum, groundnuts, and sesame seed crops.

In our scenario, analysts are trying to determine an optimal fertilizer subsidy rate for farmers in Pongo Basin to promote crop yield in 2017 lean season. The fertilizer subsidy rate can vary from 10% to 50%. 
Initially, the baseline simulated crop yield and production are displayed in Figure 1:  


![Fig1](https://files.mint.isi.edu/s/ILn4cnLyy8V0eRI/download)

**Figure 1: Estimated baseline yield and production per crop**


By imposing a 20% fertilizer subsidy, we expect the farmers to use more fertilizer as inputs for some crops thus leading to higher yield and production level and eventually higher revenue level and alleviate the food insecurity problem in Pongo Basin area during the 2017 lean season. By using EACS, the simulated yield and production level after imposing the intervention (i.e., 20% decrease in fertilizer cost for all crops, assuming the fertilizer subsidy applies to all crops within this area) is displayed in Figure 2.

![Fig2](https://files.mint.isi.edu/s/JLWumO6NrCPW5NR/download)

**Figure 2: Estimated yield and production per crop with a 20% decrease in fertilizer cost for all crops**
  
By comparing the baseline and intervention (20%) outputs, analysts may find a 20% fertilizer subsidy program lead to higher yield level for cassava and maize and higher production level for sorghum. Since the goal of the economic model is to maximize the total revenue of the farmers within this area, analysts would see the farmers make new decisions on fertilizer use and land allocation on different crops based on different interventions they choose. 

Under the same logic, analysts can run similar simulations for 10%. 30%, 40% and 50% fertilizer subsidy interventions and check the new outcomes. We display only two outcome variables of Economic model: Yield and Total Production. Extra outcome variables such as land use, fertilizer application rate and total fertilizer use are also available for analysts to check and compare within in the MINT system.  

By running multiple simulations with different economic interventions, analysts would have a general idea of how the proposed policy may impact the agricultural and economic outcomes of their interest area. The economic model outcome variables can also help them to further calculate the cost and benefit of the potential policy and finalize their decisions on policy-making. 

**Data sources**: In this scenario, the model was configured using Food and Agriculture Organization 2015 production data for baseline land use, yield and production level (http://www.fao.org/faostat). 
 Crop price data are World Food Programme database (https://data.humdata.org/dataset/wfp-food-prices-for-south-sudan) and estimated elasticities from related literatures.
