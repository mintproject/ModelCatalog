crop_seasonal_production_index,Seasonal crop production index,"Index that provides a fast and robust way of reporting normalized yields for a given grid point or region. The goal of the index is to easily segment years or seasons that can be problematic for food production, and to provide an intuitive sense of the magnitude of the problem. While the raw yield outputs might be difficult to interpret for the non-expert, the index is more transparent. It is based on the ratio of the yield of a given combination of planting date, fertilization and weed pressure to the median yield under such conditions across years. An index = 1 means that the year resembles the median years, and it is assumed that it represents a neutral condition (neither local excess or shortage of food supply). An index > 1 means that the local food supply may exceed the median, and the larger the number the better off the location. The caveat here is that flooding damage might be underestimated. As we refine our simulations this limitation will be lifted. An index < 1 means a situation worse than normal, and the lower the value the worse the situation. It is safe to assume that this is a reliable indicator of local food shortage. We are working on visualizations that map this index, to give an analyst a sense of the geographical variation of the index. The figure below shows a summary for this index for maize for one grid point in the Pongo Basin.",crop__seasonal_production_index

potential_evapotranspiration,Potential evapotranspiration,The Palmer drought indices measure the balance between moisture demand and moisture supply. Drought results from an imbalance between these two components. Precipitation provides the water supply. Water demand is usually measured by evapotranspiration (the amount of water that would be evaporated and transpired by plants) [https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/monitoring-references/dyk/potential-evapotranspiration],evaporation_volume_flux_index
river_discharge,River discharge,"River discharge is the volume of water flowing through a river channel. This is the total volume of water flowing through a channel at any given point and is measured in cubic metres per second (cumecs). The discharge from a drainage basin depends on precipitation, evapotranspiration and storage factors (http://www.geography.learnontheinternet.co.uk/topics/discharge.html)",downstream_volume_flow_rate
standardized_precipitation_evapotranspiration_index,Standardized recipitation evapotranspiration index,"The Standardised Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), has been proposed to quantify the drought condition over a given area. The SPEI considers not only precipitation but also evapotranspiration (PET) data on its calculation, allowing for a more complete approach to explore the effects of climate change on drought conditions. The SPEI can be calculated at several time scales to adapt to the characteristic times of response to drought of target natural and economic systems, allowing determining their resistance to drought.

stream_duration_index,Stream duration index,"The Streamflow - Duration Index (SDI), also called a flow-duration-curve (FDC), represents the relationship between the magnitude and frequency of daily streamflow for a particular river basin, and provides an estimate of the percentage of time a given streamflow was equaled or exceeded over the historical record of the data. An SDI provides a simple, yet comprehensive, graphical view of the overall historical variability associated with streamflow in a river basin. SDI is the complement of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of daily streamflow. Each value of discharge Q has a corresponding exceedance probability, and an SDI is simply a plot Qpversus the pthquantile or percentile of daily streamflow versus exceedance probability p = 1-Prob[Q<= Qp].",channel~stream_water__flow_duration_index
