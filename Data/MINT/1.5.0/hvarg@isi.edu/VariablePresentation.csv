cycles_threshold_temperature_for_cold_damage,THRESHOLD_TEMPERATURE_FOR_COLD_DAMAGE,"The threshold temperature (degree C) used in the calculation of the cold damage factor. If the daily minimum temperature falls below this threshold value, a cold damage factor is calculated as:

1 – (daily minimum temperature – MIN_TEMPERATURE_FOR_COLD_DAMAGE) / (THRESHOLD_TEMPERATURE_FOR_COLD_DAMAGE - MIN_TEMPERATURE_FOR_COLD_DAMAGE)

The cold damage factor reduces the aboveground crop biomass (moving it to the surface residue pools), reduces radiation interception by the canopy, and delays phenology development. Aboveground biomass and radiation interception is reduced by a factor calculated as 1 – cold damage factor^3. As an example, a daily minimum temperature below the MIN_TEMPERATURE_FOR_COLD_DAMAGE will cause the existing aboveground biomass and radiation interception to be multiplied by 0.03 (1-0.993), with the 97% of existing biomass that was killed added to the residue pools. So for a crop with an aboveground biomass of 1000 kg/ha, a day in the simulation with a minimum temperature below the MIN_TEMPERATURE_FOR_COLD_DAMAGE will reduce the aboveground biomass to 30 kg/ha and add 970 kg/ha of biomass to the residue pools.",degC,,THRESHOLD_TEMPERATURE_FOR_COLD_DAMAGE,,,,,,,
