SIR,"""SIR (Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered individuals) Model""",SIR1.0,"""Models the spread of a disease dividing a population into groups of people who are Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered (SIR).  The model divides the population into three compartments. For each location i at time t, the three compartments are as follows: 1) Si,t: the number of individuals not yet infected or susceptible to the disease; 2) Ii,t: the number of individuals infected with the disease and capable of spreading the disease to those in the susceptible group; and 3) Ri,t: the number of individuals who have been infected and then removed from the infected group, either due to recovery or due to death. Individuals in this group are not capable of contracting the disease again or transmitting the infection to others.""",,Epidemiology;Infectious disease,"""Ignores births and immigration, so noone is added to the susceptible population group; A fixed fraction k of the infected group recovers each day""",https://towardsdatascience.com/modelling-the-coronavirus-epidemic-spreading-in-a-city-with-python-babd14d82fa2,,smith_david,"""The SIR Model for Spread of Disease, David Smith and Lang Moore,  Convergence, December 2004. -- https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/loci/joma/the-sir-model-for-spread-of-disease""",moore_lang,,2004,,,https://towardsdatascience.com/modelling-the-coronavirus-epidemic-spreading-in-a-city-with-python-babd14d82fa2,,,,,sirc_code,,epidemiology; disease; population,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
