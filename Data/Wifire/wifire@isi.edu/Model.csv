HIGRAD_FIRETEC,HIGRAD/FIRETEC,,,"""HIGRAD/FIRETEC is a physics-based, 3-D computer code designed to simulate the constantly changing, interactive relationship between fire and its environment. It does so by representing the coupled interaction between fire, fuels, atmosphere, and topography on a landscape scale (hundreds or thousands of meters). """,,"""Unlike the empirically based models currently used in the field, FIRETEC simulates the dynamic processes that occur within a fire and the way those processes feed off and alter each other. FIRETEC takes the huge computational resources at the Los Alamos National Laboratory to run, so it is currently a research tool only.""",Fire,,,https://w3id.org/okn/o/sdm#CoupledModel,lanl;rmrs,"""Hanson H.P., Bradley M.M., Bossert J.E., Linn R.

quic_fire,QUIC-fire,,quic_urb,""" Simulation tool designed to rapidly solve these feedbacks by coupling the mature 3-D rapid wind solver QUIC-URB to a physicsbased cellular automata fire spread model Fire-CA. QUIC-Fire uses 3-D fuels inputs similar to the CFD model FIRETEC, allowing this tool to simulate effects of fuel structure on local winds and fire behavior. Results comparing fire behavior metrics to the computational fluid dynamic model FIRETEC show strong agreement. QUIC-Fire is the first tool intended to provide an opportunity for prescribed fire planners to compare, evaluate, and design burn plans, including complex ignition patterns and coupled fire-atmospheric feedbacks.""",,,Fire,,,https://w3id.org/okn/o/sdm#CoupledModel,RRLinn;SLGoodrick;SBrambilla;Brown_Michael;RSMiddleton;JJOBrien;JKHiers,"""Linn, R.R.; Goodrick, S.L.; Brambilla, S.; Brown, M.J.; Middleton, R.S.; O'Brien, J.J.; Hiers, J.K. 2020.

quic_urb,QUIC-URB,,,"""QUIC-URB is a fast running model for computing mean flow fields around buildings. It uses empirical algorithms and mass conservation to quickly compute 3D flow fields around building complexes. The underlying code is based on the work of Röckle (1990).  Flow parameterizations for the downwind cavity and wake, upwind cavity, rooftop recirculation zone, the street canyon vortex, and intersections are applied to buildings based on the prevailing wind direction and their height, width, length, and spacing.  Mass conservation is then imposed and a 3D wind field is produced.   Some of the original Röckle schemes have been modified to better agree with experimental data and new schemes have also been introduced (see QUIC Reports). QUIC-URB has been modified to account for dense urban areas, semi-complex building shapes, and forest-induced drag.   The model can assimilate wind measurements (e.g., SODAR profiles) and has a nested grid capability so that larger problems can be run (i.e., the inner grid resolves buildings and the outer grid does not).  For small problems of a few buildings, the code runs in seconds on a standard single processor laptop.  For larger problems with a few million grid cells encompassing several square kilometers in a downtown built-up area, the code may take from 5 to 15 minutes to run.   Numerous evaluation studies have been performed and can be found on the QUIC Reports page.""",,,AtmosphericDispersion,,,https://w3id.org/okn/o/sdm#Theory-GuidedModel,lanl,,,,,,Brown_Michael,,,,,quic_urb_vis,,,atmospheric dispersion modeling,,,,,,,,,"""QUIC-URB is a fast running model for computing mean flow fields around buildings.
